(a) Advantages of TDD:
	- The possible problems and corner cases are thought of in advance, most probably leading to a less buggy and more precise code (not outputting too much and not too little).
	- It is easier to find the source of a mistake.
	- The programmer will most likely have better-structured code and also understand their code better.

	We are not sure whether we understand the question correctly. Because before we really structure 
the codes of processing.py, we have already looked at the given test example, for example, 
for the test_output_split_into_sentences_function, we already know that we should return a list,
and the "\n" should be treated as a sentence, when implementing the code, we have a clearer structure
For the second function, we know that we return a list of lists of strings, it is also very helpful. 


(b) We tested the type of the output against our expectations.
	We also tested the length of the output list.
	We tested whether the element in a certain position of the output is right.
	We tested whether the result is equal to our target.
	
(c) The task is doable but difficult to get the perfect output.
	we spend almost 8-9 hours in it.
	The unit test part is really helpful for understanding the lecture.
	We find it somehow a little bit overwhelming to explore GitLab.
